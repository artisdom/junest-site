JuNest
======
The Arch Linux based distro that runs upon any Linux distros without root access

{% include star-me.html %}

Description
===========
**JuNest** (Jailed User NEST) is a lightweight Arch Linux based distribution that allows to have
an isolated GNU/Linux environment inside any generic host GNU/Linux OS
and without the need to have root privileges for installing packages.

JuNest contains mainly the package managers (called pacman and yaourt) that allows to access
to a wide range of packages from the Arch Linux repositories.

The main advantages on using JuNest are:

- Install packages without root privileges.
- Isolated environment in which you can install packages without affecting a production system.
- Access to a wide range of packages in particular on GNU/Linux distros that may contain limited repositories (such as CentOS and RedHat).
- Available for x86\_64, x86 and ARM architectures but you can build your own image from scratch too!
- All Arch Linux lovers can have their favourite distro everywhere!

JuNest follows the [Arch Linux philosophy](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/The_Arch_Way).
