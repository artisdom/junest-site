JuJube
======
The Arch Linux based distro that runs upon any Linux distros without root access

{% include star-me.html %}

Description
===========
**JuJube** is a lightweight Arch Linux based distribution that allows to have
an isolated GNU/Linux environment inside any generic host GNU/Linux OS
and without the need to have root privileges for installing packages.

JuJube contains mainly the package managers (called pacman and yaourt) that allows to access
to a wide range of packages from the Arch Linux repositories.

The main advantages on using JuJube are:

- Install packages without root privileges.
- Isolated environment in which you can install packages without affecting a production system.
- Access to a wide range of packages in particular on GNU/Linux distros that may contain limited repositories (such as CentOS and RedHat).
- Available for x86\_64, x86 and ARM architectures but you can build your own image from scratch too!
- All Arch Linux lovers can have their favourite distro everywhere!

JuJube follows the [Arch Linux philosophy](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/The_Arch_Way).

Quote of the [lotus](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ziziphus_lotus) (a selvatic jujube plant)

> Per nove infausti dì sul mar pescoso  
> i venti rei mi trasportaro. Al fine  
> nel decimo sbarcammo in su le rive  
> de’ Lotofági, un popolo, a cui cibo  
> È d’una pianta il florido germoglio.  
> ...  
> ...  
> Partiro e s’affrontaro a quella gente,  
> che, lunge dal voler la vita loro,  
> il dolce loto a savorar lor porse.  
> chiunque l’esca dilettosa, e nuova  
> gustato avea, con le novelle indietro  
> non bramava tornar: colà bramava  
> starsi, e, mangiando del soave loto,  
> la contrada natia sbandir dal petto.
