JChroot
=======

JChroot represents a replacement to the
[arch-chroot](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Chroot) previously
used in JuNest.
The main reason we have decided to remove arch-chroot is because it was not
meant to be a portable script. The arch-chroot script is usually used during
the installation of Arch Linux distro and it contains some commands
(like unshare) that are not common on some old distros.

Furthermore, the arch-chroot belongs to the package arch-install-scripts which
contains few dependencies. So, at the time the arch-chroot was part of the
JuNest image, the image was bigger few tens of megabytes more.

JChroot takes just the main part of arch-chroot, namely, the mounts
of the primary directories (i.e. /proc, /sys, /dev and /run) and the classic
chroot executable. So, with JChroot we have a small and portable script that,
also, drastically reduced the size of the JuNest image.
